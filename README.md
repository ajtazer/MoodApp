# MoodAppv2

MoodNotes is a Python Django web application that aims to provide a platform for users to express and share their mood through written notes, inspired by Instagram's Notes feature. The application is currently in development, with the login and registration models already implemented using the Django framework.

With MoodNotes, users can create an account, log in securely, and start capturing their emotions by writing personalized notes. Whether it's a joyful moment, a thought-provoking reflection, or a simple expression of one's state of mind, MoodNotes allows users to document their moods in a convenient and organized manner.

Although the initial features are limited to user authentication, the development of MoodNotes is ongoing, and exciting new functionalities are planned for future releases. The roadmap includes features such as creating, editing, and deleting notes, adding tags and categories for better organization, integrating user profiles, and incorporating social sharing options to enhance the user experience.

Previously hosted on PythonAnywhere, the repository now seeks alternative hosting options due to the expiration of the free trial. The repository serves as a collaborative space for developers to contribute to the project, assisting in the development of additional features, bug fixes, and improvements.

Contributors interested in web development, Python, Django, and frontend technologies are encouraged to join the MoodNotes project. By collaborating together, we can shape MoodNotes into a robust and user-friendly application that empowers individuals to express their emotions creatively and connect with others who resonate with their moods.
